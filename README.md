Idea repo for a site for making a registry of all kanji with OCR capabilities

###About 

This repository is meant to be a planning document for a site with the following objectives:

 * To provide a beautiful catalogue of all Kanji, Kana, and Hanz√¨.
 * To provide a usable dictionary and etymology for characters, in any language where that character is used.
 * To provide a resource for tracing the etymology of characters.
 * To provide a library for OCR techniques to automatically recognize characters(in as far as it is possible to do so)
 * To explain what Unicode characters exist for each character, if any.

These goals are not far fetched. [Ukiyo-e.org]() is a good example of a site that has managed to do this already for another resource, namely, ukiyo-e prints. The technical problems are different there; however, some of the same techniques and design problems and solutions are adoptable.

###Contribute

For now, this is a planning document. Any questions or discussions should happen in the [issues](https://github.com/RichardLitt/kanjin/issues). Please join in!
